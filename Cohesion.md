# Cohesion
- Measure of how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a module
- The more cohesive your classes are, the less coupled they will be

Coincidental Cohesion: Unrelated functions put together. Should always avoid
Logical Cohesion: Functions are grouped based on a logical category
Temporal Cohesion: Functions executed at the same time
Procedural Cohesion: Functions that follow a sequence 
Communicational Cohesion: Functions that work on the same data 
Sequential Cohesion: Functions where the output of one is the input of the next
Functional Cohesion: All functions contribute to a single, well-defined task (best form)
