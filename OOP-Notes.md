Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. These objects are instances of classes, which bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities and their interactions.

Key Features:

Class-based: Code is organized into classes, which define the blueprint for objects.

Encapsulation: Bundling of data and methods within classes to restrict access and protect state.

Inheritance: Mechanism to create new classes based on existing classes to promote code reuse.
Inheritance - Inherit all properties, behaviors and override or add some

Polymorphism: Ability to use a common interface for different underlying forms (methods).

Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.



Encapsulation is kind of protection wrapper around data and behavior.
Encapsulation is the process of keeping property and method inside abstracted object(class) and controlling access.

Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common supertype. This is achieved through method overriding and interfaces.
Polymorphism enables a single interface to be used for a general class of actions, allowing for flexibility and the ability to switch between different implementations.


An interface defines a contract or a set of methods that implementing classes must provide. It specifies what methods a class must implement but does not provide the implementation details.
Interfaces promote decoupling and enhance code flexibility and reusability by ensuring that different classes can interact with each other through a common set of methods.
 An interface consists only unimplemented methods.
